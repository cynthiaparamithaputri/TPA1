            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I usually go by Cynthia and I'm a 21 year old student from Gunadarma University who is currently learning to become a web developer. My interest in web developing started because I want to be able to make a website for my mother's small business,
                she resells prayer hijab as a side job just to distribute more beautiful muslim's praying equipment to other women.<br><br>This year I've had the opportunity to make a scientific writing on how to make a web based application using SDLC
                Waterfall method and with the help of Bootstrap. Currently I'm an assistant for the institutional course LePKom since 2021.
